<h1>
  About Me!
</h1>
<h3>
<p><div>
  Karissa Chu is currently a junior at Burlingame High School. She is hoping to study majors related to food science and or computer science. She has always been interested in cooking as well as the nutritional aspect of food. (Click My Food! above to see her food blog.) She became interested in computer science after joining the Girls Who Code club. She further expressed this interest through a Girls Who Code program at Intuit learning the basics of multiple languages. This program showed Karissa the significance of computer science and why having knowledge of this subject is useful. This program also explained how women are often the minority in STEM fields, which inspired Karissa to follow her interests as well. Outside of school, Karissa has a job tutoring younger kids, primarily in math, but other subjects as well. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with friends, usually watching movies and finding new places to eat. She also enjoys playing and watching soccer as well as watching other sports.
