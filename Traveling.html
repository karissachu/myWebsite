  Project Summary:
</h2>
<h3>
  In this project, for my AP Computer Science class, I created objects to represent a store where there is a shopping cart. In this class, there are 5 attributes including the store name, the product type, the cost of the product, inventory of the product and if it is in stock or not. The relationship shown in this project shows class composition since a mall has a store. There is also a makeup store and clothing store, which are both stores. Both of these stores also implement the Advertise interface. By implementing this interface, each class prints a statement through the commercial method to advertise for its store. It also calculates a discount for the individual store. Although the store class contains many methods, most of them are just to change and access the attributes. The mall class is where most of the methods that perform tasks are. For example, some of the methods include the alphabetBrand method, the expensive method, and the overloaded setAddRemove methods. The alphabetBrand method takes the list of stores and sorts them in alphabetical order. The expensive method also takes the list of stores but it calculates the most expensive price from the list of objects. The overloaded methods perform similar but opposite actions. One method takes in a string to add a store to the list of objects while the second method takes in an int to remove a store from the list of objects. My code has may appear to have many lines of output, but many of these lines show changes to the list of objects where the output is the list of objects in the cart.
